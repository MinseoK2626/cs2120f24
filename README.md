Here's the initial state of the evolving git repository
for our class. If you don't know what something means (e.g.,'
what's a git repo and how to fork one on GitHub) there are
videos all over Youtube, TikTok, or whatever.

## Setup

Here are instructions for getting started.

Getting started:

- if you don't have a GitHub account, get one
- if you don't have git installed on your laptop, do that now
  - MacOS: xcode-select --install
  - Windows: <https://git-scm.com/download/win>
- Log into your github account
- Navigate in GitHub to this repository
- fork *this/my* GitHub repo (makes a copy in *your* GitHub account)
- navigate back to your account, get the URL for your new repo copy
- then use that URL to clone *your* fork (on GitHub) onto your laptop
- if you don't already have it, install VSCode
- in VSCode install the lean4 extension
- in VSCode "File > open folder" your new cloned *directory*
- click on Main.lean; VSCode will install Lean
- sometimes you need to tell Lean to re-process a "red" file with CMD/CTRL-SHIFT-P the "Lean4: Restart File"
- to be able to run Python files you'll need to have Python installed on your laptop
  - many will have python3 installed (as python), otherwise https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3125/
  - install the python3 extension in VSCode
